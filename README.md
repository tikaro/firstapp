# .NET Core MVC, Mac, and Azure

This is a repo for me to practice:

1. Making a .NET Core MVC app
2. On a Mac
3. Using VS Code
4. With the [C# Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) installed
5. And the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/)
6. Hosting it on Github, and finally
7. Deploying the whole thing to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

I'm following the recipe here:
